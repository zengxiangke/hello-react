## XForm(./src/lib/xform): build a form by configuration only
In a application, we often build similar forms individually by hand, many of works are duplicate.
So it will be much great to build a from only by configuration, according to our business.
And make it type safe by the powerful typing system of Typescript. You will get full intellisense for
form fields definition and form value.
